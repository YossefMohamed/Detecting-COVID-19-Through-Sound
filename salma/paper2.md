# Date :
##### 6 Aug 2021

# features :  
##### 1. 2,600-dimensional log Mel feature set
##### 2. 1,400-dimensional Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature set
##### 3. 6,373-dimensional COMPUTATIONAL PARALINGUISTICS CHALLENGE (COMPARE) 2016 feature set
##### 4. Deep neural network "DNN"
 

# Dataset :
##### Our proposed approaches are evaluated on the dataset of Track-1 (cough sounds) of the DiCOVA 2021 challenge.

# classification : 
##### 1. heart sound classification
##### 2. cold speech detection
 

# accuracy : 
##### the feature-level attention achieves an AUC of 77.96% on the test set, resulting in an improvement of the baseline
