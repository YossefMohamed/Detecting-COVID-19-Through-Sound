**_Summary & Future Work_**

_The proposed work shows
that Quadratic SVM Model was best in terms of
performance while differentiating COVID-19 cough from
healthy ones with an AUC of 0.98._

_The proposed work with
Machine learning requires features to be explicitly provided
and select as to which feature results in building the
classification model with maximum accuracy._ 

_The proposed approach of cough based classification towards non-Covid individuals can be extended with other respiratory illnesses as well like bronchitis, pertussis, asthma etc._
_so as to correctly distinguish coughs due to COVID-19 and these respiratory ailments._ 
_The more practical solution can be reached by using large dataset samples using neural network
and deep learning algorithms._
