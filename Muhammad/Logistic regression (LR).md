# _What is Regression Analysis?_
**_Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. For example, relationship between rash driving and number of road accidents by a driver is best studied through regression._**

**_Regression analysis is an important tool for modelling and analyzing data. Here, we fit a curve / line to the data points, in such a manner that the differences between the distances of data points from the curve or line is minimized.  I’ll explain this in more details in coming sections._**

# _Why do we use Regression Analysis?_
_As mentioned above, regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables. Let’s understand this with an easy example:_

_Let’s say, you want to estimate growth in sales of a company based on current economic conditions. You have the recent company data which indicates that the growth in sales is around two and a half times the growth in the economy. Using this insight, we can predict future sales of the company based on current & past information._

**_There are multiple benefits of using regression analysis. They are as follows:_**

- _It indicates the significant relationships between dependent variable and independent variable._
- _It indicates the strength of impact of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable._

_Regression analysis also allows us to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales, such as the effect of price changes and the number of promotional activities. These benefits help market researchers / data analysts / data scientists to eliminate and evaluate the best set of variables to be used for building predictive models_

# _A Type Of Regression Is  **Logistic Regression**_
**_Logistic regression is used to find the probability of event=Success and event=Failure. We should use logistic regression when the dependent variable is binary (0/ 1, True/ False, Yes/ No) in nature._**
